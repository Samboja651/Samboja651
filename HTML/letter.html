  <p><bold></b>Dear Granton,</bold></p>
  <p>I am in a team of like minded individuals and have implemented a tech solution that favors people in desert areas. We are making money using the suns energy, using the money to invest in financial markets and help people like those in Turkana.</p>
  <p>I feel motivated and joyful seeing the solutions I give turn people’s lives and make them happy.</p>
  <p>Its been a long process and I’ve had to :
    <ul>Sacrifice and dedicate my time & energy to tech</ul>
    <ul>Take loans to fund my learning</ul>
    <ul>Sacrifice enjoyment of bashes & parties to tech</ul>
    <ul>Relentlessly rise up again even after being knocked down </ul>
    <ul>Donate tech services all to sharpen my skills</ul>
    
  </p>
  <h3>Advice</h3>
  <p>Be ready to sacrifice, have a strong heart, learn the skills, love your computer because you are going to code, a lot, and embrace team work – it has made me to be consistent.</p>
  <p>Yours caring </p>
  <p>Granton Waribe</p>
