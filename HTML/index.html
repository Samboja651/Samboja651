  <h2>My Core Identies</h2>
  <p>In my core identity values, the ones that clearly portray and govern my life are, Focus, identity and relationship. In my definition Focus, means  setting a goal, dedicate total time and energy to it and removing any barriers that deter the goal. Identity is myself, my personality and how I behave. Relationship involves my family friends and God. I strongly value how I relate and communicate with each.</p>
  <h3>Focus</h3>
  <p>
Recently I enrolled on the Kibo (fpwp), my future message was, “now I can comfortably work on simple projects”. I took my course serious, attended all classes, asked questions where I struggled to understand , tried out the code taught in class and completed all projects.  As a result of the effort, I created a program on Hotel that enables a customer to read menu , order food and pay for it. I now have certificate in python from Kibo. Am happy.
</p>
  <h3>Identity</h3>
  <p> 
In school, we had been given a project to work in a group of five, I was the team leader,  the task was hard and we were all stuck on the problem. Being persistent, I couldn’t let the group fail, I encouraged the members emphasizing that every problem has an answer, we did wide research and came up with a solution. I practiced integrity when I denied to a non-member to the group who tried to borrow the group work from me and replicate it as there’s (copying).
On march 17 2023 I enrolled in a student summit for google cloud.  The summit was closing after one day . I wanted the badge. To attain it I had to spend a whole night learning and practicing on their labs and before sun shine I had completed. You can find the badge in my google account profile or LinkedIn. 
</p>
  <h3>Relationship</h3>
  <p>
Two weeks ago,  I enrolled on the Kibo (fpwp) in a team of three called team success. The team leader became busy with his own activities, I took up the role of team leader but communication and interacting with others was a problem to me because am an introvert. The group became dormant. I had failed. It is from this scenario that I came to understand how important it is to know how to communicate and interact with others. I have been putting super effort in communication so that next time am in a team its super active.

   <h1>Know more about me</h1>
  <p>I help people solve problems. They usually come to me because they need peace and want to find solutions to their problems.</p>
  <p>If I had all the  money in the world, I would use my time to help people solve problems and make their lives better.</p>
  <p>I feel happy and joyful when I learn something new and solve a difficult problem.</p>
  <p>Am motivated when I listen to songs and positive people with similar experience.</p>
  <p>The young learners especially in my local school, they don’t have people to emulate/role models, they feel inferior learning in a village school and feel nothing big can come out of them, that’s why I get restless at night and work hard to utilize the opportunities I get, one day I will become a source of motivation to the young lives.</p>
 <p>Am good at solving computer errors that is from software or installation problem and even TV signal loss ( did at village), people mostly come to me when they have tampered with their devices and can’t restore them to usable state, without know how to solve it, I curiously try all possibilities I Imagine and one of them always seems to work. They become relieved and at peace, stress disappears.
